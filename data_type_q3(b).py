Problem 3 (B)
Suppose we have to take two string as “56.78” and “0.28” from user. Convert these two strings into floating data type. Calculate their Sum and display the sum at output screen. (Note: Your code must run for similar type of inputs)
"""




first= float(input("Enter the first number: "))
second= float(input("Enter the second number: "))
Add = first+second
print(f"The sum of {first} and {second} is {Add}")
